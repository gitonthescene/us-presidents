   Here "home state" is actually the state the President was born in for lack of a better
   definition of home state.  It was collected from [[https://www.wikidata.org/][Wikidata]] with the following query:

   #+begin_src sql
   SELECT ?president ?presidentLabel ?birthLabel WHERE {
     ?president p:P39 ?stmt;
                wdt:P31 wd:Q5.
     OPTIONAL { ?president wdt:P19/wdt:P131+ ?birth.
                ?birth wdt:P31 wd:Q35657. }
     
     ?stmt ps:P39 wd:Q11696 ;
           pq:P580 ?start.

     SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en". }
   } ORDER BY ?start
