* U.S. Presidents
  [[https://apps.ankiweb.net/][Anki]] deck built with [[https://github.com/ohare93/brain-brew][brain-brew]] based on this [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/969647708][previous deck]].

** Columns
   - Order
   - Name
   - Time
   - Party
   - Home State

   Here "home state" is actually the state the President was born in for lack of a better
   definition of home state.  It was collected from [[https://www.wikidata.org/][Wikidata]] with the following query:

   #+begin_src sql
   SELECT ?president ?presidentLabel ?birthLabel WHERE {
     ?president p:P39 ?stmt;
                wdt:P31 wd:Q5.
     OPTIONAL { ?president wdt:P19/wdt:P131+ ?birth.
                ?birth wdt:P31 wd:Q35657. }
     
     ?stmt ps:P39 wd:Q11696 ;
           pq:P580 ?start.

     SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en". }
   } ORDER BY ?start
   #+end_src

** Loading
   The output of Brain Brew can be found in the ~build/~ folder.  This is in [[https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki][CrowdAnki]] format and
   can be imported into Anki using the [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778][CrowdAnki plugin]].
     
** Editing
   Per the Brain Brew instructions new rows can simply be added to the csv files in the ~data/~
   folder.

   When adding new cards, I've found it's easiest to first edit the deck in Anki by creating sample
   data, exporting that on top of the original deck, filling out the rest of the data and then
   building the edited deck Brain Brew.
